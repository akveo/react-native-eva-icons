- typescript is compiled into javascript without errors which works properly
- tests are added/updated and passing
- commit message is properly formatted

## Framework Structure

- lib - Framework itself, represents the package published to npm.
- playground - Separated demo application used to quickly debug changes.

    - src - contains source scripts launched from ts-node scripts
      
## Icons 

Located in [./lib/icons](./lib/icons). In master branch generated source code is not tracked, [see why](./README.md#where-is-icons-source-code).

## Development

### Generate Icons

Run `npm run clean:lib && npm run generate`. This will cleanup generated sources and replace it with a new one.

### Creating a Playground Demo

If you're working on a feature which can affect UI please create a short demo on it in a playground app. To do that, simply create React component demonstrating this feature in ./playground/showcase dir.

Before running an app make sure you have generated icons in a ./lib dir so application can resolve it.

To run a playground application use `npm start`.
